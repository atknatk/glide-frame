# GitHub Actions workflow for building and deploying Next.js to GitHub Pages
#
# This workflow:
# 1. Triggers after release workflow completes or on manual dispatch
# 2. Installs dependencies using pnpm
# 3. Builds the Next.js application with static export
# 4. Deploys the output to GitHub Pages
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Repository Settings > Pages > Source: GitHub Actions
# - next.config.ts must have output: 'export' and basePath configured
